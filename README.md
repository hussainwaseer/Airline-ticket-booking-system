# ‚úàÔ∏è AHS Airplane Ticket Booking System

A console-based C++ application to simulate an airline ticket booking system. It allows users to register flight details, choose travel classes, and print out ticket information. This project is suitable for beginner-to-intermediate learners practicing file handling, arrays, conditionals, loops, and formatted output in C++.

## üìã Features

- ‚úÖ One-way & Two-way ticket support  
- üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß Passenger types: Adults, Children, Infants  
- ‚è∞ Departure and Return time selection  
- üõ´ Choose departure and arrival countries from files  
- ‚úàÔ∏è Plane types and class (Business / Economy) options  
- üìÑ Auto-generates formatted tickets in console  
- üßæ Stores ticket data in `Record.xls` (can be opened in Excel)  
- üìÇ Reads from external files like:
  - `ARRIVAL_COUNTRIES.txt`
  - `DEPARTURE_TIME.txt`
  - `AIRCRAFT_TYPES.txt`
  - `CLASS.txt`

## üßë‚Äçüíª How to Run

### üíª Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g. g++, Visual C++)
- Any terminal (Command Prompt, Bash, etc.)
- `Record.xls` and required `.txt` files in the same directory

### üîß Compile

```bash
g++ -o ticket_booking main.cpp
üöÄ Run
bash
./ticket_booking


üóÇ File Structure

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.cpp                # Main application source code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ARRIVAL_COUNTRIES.txt  # List of destination countries
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DEPARTURE_TIME.txt     # List of departure/return time options
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AIRCRAFT_TYPES.txt     # Available aircraft types
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLASS.txt              # Ticket class info (Business / Economy)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Record.xls             # Auto-generated record of bookings
üß† Concepts Covered
ofstream / ifstream for file I/O

setw() and left/right for formatting

String manipulation and user input handling

Arrays for storing passenger data

Conditional logic and loops

Functions with reference parameters

üìå Notes
All records are saved in Record.xls using tab-separated values.

Ensure all .txt files exist with valid data for smooth flow.

Designed for terminal use ‚Äî uses system("cls"), system("pause"), and sleep().

‚úÖ To-Do / Suggestions
 Convert data storage to .csv for better Excel compatibility

 Add error-handling for file reading

 Refactor repeated code into reusable functions

 Add GUI with Qt or migrate to web-based interface
